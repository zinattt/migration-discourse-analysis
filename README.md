# Migration Discourse Analysis

## Computational Analysis of Migration-Related Discourse in the European Parliament

This project investigates migration-related discourse in European Parliament speeches from 1999–2024 using computational linguistics and natural language processing techniques.

The analysis examines migration-, refugee-, and asylum-related vocabulary, changes in discourse over time, semantic patterns, and sentiment, with particular attention to the period before and after 2015.

## Data

The analysis uses the **Corpus of the EU Parliament Debates (1999–2024)**, containing **563,696 speeches** in original languages and English translations.

**Data source:** [Zenodo – Corpus of the EU Parliament Debates](https://zenodo.org/records/20085298)

The original corpus is not included in this repository because of its large file size.

## Key Findings

- Migration-related terms occurred **61,012 times**, compared with **27,944 refugee-related** and **17,523 asylum-related** occurrences.
- Migration-related discourse increased sharply in **2015 and 2016**, with 4,808 and 7,390 speeches respectively.
- Refugee-related discourse also increased substantially in 2015–2016, reaching 3,371 and 4,743 speeches.
- Semantic analysis showed increased **security** and **humanitarian** similarity after 2015, while financial similarity remained unchanged.
- Sentiment projection decreased from **0.108 before 2015 to 0.041 after 2015**.
